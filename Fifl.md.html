<p style="font-size: 1.5em;color:gray; margin-top: 0em;">A Python based 2D visulization and raytracing API</p>

# Abstract

<i>Fun In Flatland</i> is an API to facilitate the prototyping of 2D raytracing algorithms. It provides the basic infrastructure required to create a scene such as materials, objects and camera along with their intersection routines. One important aspect of the API is that all objects, camera and math primitives such as points, vectors, normals, and rays can be visualized.</p>
