# Abstract

Rayster is a 3D hybrid rendering system for research and experimental purposes. The target applications include denoising across space and time, direct illumination, analytic shading and distribution effects such as soft shadows, depth of field and motion blur. Rayster complements offline raytracers such as Mitsuba, which are not ideal for prototyping real-time/interactive applications. There is also a plan to use Embree for exploring multi-core CPU for control-divergence prone multi-bounce effects in combination with GPU for single bounce effects.
